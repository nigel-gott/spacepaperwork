                Items can now be created in {{ SITE_NAME }} without first making a
                fleet.
            </p>
            <p>
                Visit <a href="{% url 'personal_items_add' %}">here</a> to do so or find
                it under the newly renamed <strong>Items</strong> menu and then click
                <strong>Your Items</strong>. Items created this way are owned 100% by
                the character you select when adding the items. Otherwise they work just
                like items added using a fleet, so you can still contract them to a
                seller or sell them yourselves and you will get 100% of the profit.
