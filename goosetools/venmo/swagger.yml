        This method allows bulk updating transactions which are in the "pending" transaction_state only (this is enforced in the backend) in bulk.

        If the destination discordId doesn't currently exist that's not an issue, this method will handle creating the user and adding their space bucks from the transfer.

        If the originating discordId doesn't have enough space bucks either in raw balance of they have pending transactions then a 409 error is returned.

        If any errors are hit updating the any of the transactions in the batch then the entire transaction is rolledback.

        Otherwise it returns a 200 when completed successfully.
